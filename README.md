# linear-reg-cpp
linear reg at it's base low-level

A few General Statements:
 * I'm sorry if my code is super ambiguous as I just mushed a bunch of stuff into one file and there are no comments and the naming is quite ambigous
 * This is a very inefficient way of doing linear regression that you shouldnâ€™t use and that i plan to update to be faster, this will run in O(n) under these limits but if this approach was taken with no limits, it would anywhere as bad as O(n^2) or O(n^3).

I have preconfigured the executable file for you to run so you don't have to compile shit with gcc or clang++ or whatever
